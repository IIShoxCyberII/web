  <h1>Time is not endless</h1>
  <p>In this game, you find yourself stranded on a deserted island with no means of escaping other than by building a boat. Your main objective is to gather resources such as wood, food, and water to stay alive. You start with nothing, but as you explore the island, you will discover new items that can be used for crafting and building your boat.</p>

  <p>As you collect resources, you will also encounter various hazards like storms, predators, and other environmental threats that will try to hinder your progress. You must use your skills to overcome these challenges while also managing your inventory and resources wisely.</p>
    
  <p>To build a boat, you will need to gather and combine various materials such as logs, ropes, and sails. You will also need to find a safe location to build your boat, as well as acquire the necessary tools to aid you in the construction process.</p>
    
  <p>Once your boat is complete, you will need to navigate your way through the treacherous waters surrounding the island, dodging obstacles and avoiding enemy ships. You must also ensure that your boat has enough resources to sustain you during the journey.</p>
    
  <p>Ultimately, the success of your escape depends on your ability to survive on the island, gather resources, and construct a seaworthy vessel. Will you be able to overcome the challenges and make it off the island alive?</p>
